!!! info "A fresh start"

    **`django-graphex`** is a new, rewritten library — the successor to
    `graphene-django-extras`. Its history starts at **1.0.0** below. If you are
    coming from `graphene-django-extras` 1.x, the [Migration Guide](migration.md)
    explains every change with before/after examples (install `django-graphex`,
    import `django_graphex`).

## 1.0.0

The first release. A GraphQL + Django toolkit built directly on `graphene`
(graphene-core) and **Pydantic v2** — **no** `graphene-django`, **no**
`djangorestframework`, **no** `django-filter`.

### Model types, mutations & the native backend
- **`DjangoModelType` / `DjangoModelMutation`** — define a Django model once and get
  query, list and create/update/delete operations. Backed by `Meta.model` and a
  native **Pydantic v2** `SerializerBackend` that validates and persists with the
  Django ORM (field types, `max_length`, `Decimal` precision, required/nullable/
  defaults, `choices` → `Enum`, FK pk types, M2M as a list of pks), and runs the
  DB-level checks Pydantic can't — **FK existence**, **uniqueness** and
  `unique_together`. Supports partial updates.
- **Custom validation** without a serializer: declare DRF-style inline
  `validate_<field>(self, value)` and an object-level `validate(self, data)` directly
  on the class, and/or pass a `Meta.pydantic_model` with validators (they compose).
- **Atomic, relation-aware nested writes** — `Meta.nested_fields = {field: Model}`
  for forward FK, reverse FK and M2M children, written in one transaction (parent or
  child failure rolls everything back) with `field.subfield` error paths.
- **Custom output fields** declared on a `DjangoModelType` are honored, including
  their `resolve_<field>` resolver methods (and `source=`), inherited/overridable
  down the MRO.

### Filtering
- **Native `and` / `or` / `not` filtering** through a single nested `filter:`
  argument (a generated `<Model>FilterInput`), built on Django's ORM lookups + `Q`
  objects. Per-field lookups, relation descent (auto `.distinct()` on to-many joins),
  plain-pk / `UUIDField` filtering (`id: { exact/in }`), and `choices` filtered via
  their `Enum`. Declared with `Meta.filter_fields` (list or dict form); the common
  base lookup set is configurable via `COMMON_FILTER_LOOKUPS`. A `FilterBackend` seam
  keeps it swappable.
- Custom filtering logic via the `get_queryset` / `filter_queryset` hooks.

### Lists, pagination & performance
- Three paginators — **`LimitOffsetGraphqlPagination`**, **`PageGraphqlPagination`**
  and **`CursorGraphqlPagination`** (keyset cursor with a non-opaque `pageInfo`).
  Pagination/ordering live on the `results(...)` subfield; lists expose the uniform
  `results` / `totalCount` shape, including **nested** related lists.
- **Automatic N+1 query optimization** — `select_related` / `prefetch_related` /
  `.only()` derived from the GraphQL selection (incl. filtered nested-list
  prefetches), tunable with `OPTIMIZE_QUERYSET` / `OPTIMIZE_ONLY_FIELDS`.
- An effective `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` ceiling applied even when no page-size arg is sent.

### Subscriptions
- Real-time GraphQL **subscriptions over Django Channels 4** (optional
  `[subscriptions]` extra) with an in-house signal → `group_send` engine; configurable
  notification payload (id-only vs full) and value-scoped "indexed" groups.

### Permissions & security
- DRF-style **permission classes** (`BasePermission`, `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdmin`,
  `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly`, …) usable on types, subscriptions and views.
- **Query depth limiting** (`MAX_QUERY_DEPTH` / `Meta.max_deep`) and **query cost
  analysis** (`MAX_QUERY_COST` / `Meta.complexity`, optional `extensions.cost`).
- **Security middlewares** — `DisableIntrospectionMiddleware`,
  `AuthenticatedFieldsMiddleware` — and `ExtraGraphQLSchema` for declaring private
  fields. Every execution error carries a machine-readable `extensions.code`.

### Views
- **`GraphQLView`** (response caching + depth/cost rules + `extensions.cost`),
  **`BaseGraphQLView`** (minimal, self-contained — no `graphene-django`), and
  **`AuthenticatedGraphQLView`** (endpoint-level auth gate via the library's own
  permission classes, no DRF). GraphiQL is served from a self-contained CDN page,
  overridable with `graphiql_template` for offline / strict-CSP setups.

### Directives
- Schema directives for string/number/list/date transforms (`@title_case`,
  `@snake_case`, `@slugify`, `@truncate`, `@round`, `@abs`, `@unique`, `@date`, …;
  custom directive names are snake_case), with directive arguments as GraphQL
  variables.

### Requirements
- **Python** 3.12–3.14, **Django** 4.0–6.0, **graphene** >=3.3,<4, **pydantic** >=2,<3.
